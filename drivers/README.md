# DOWNLOAD DRIVERS HERE
Download and un-zip drivers from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ABbJuZWEdccWUk9PVA in order to work properly. The default PATH for the drivers is in this directory. The drivers folder should be unpacked here - take them out from 'drivers' folder. Required structure is '/path/to/project/drivers/name-of-driver' not '/path/to/project/drivers/drivers/name-of-driver/'.

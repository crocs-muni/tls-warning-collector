# DOWNLOAD DRIVERS HERE
* Download and un-zip drivers from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ABbJuZWEdccWUk9PVA in order to work properly.
* Choose either x86 or x64 (without suffix) according to your OS architecture.
* This foder should contain the drivers directly â€“ take them out from `drivers` folder. The required structure is `/path/to/project/drivers/name-of-driver` not `/path/to/project/drivers/drivers/name-of-driver`.
